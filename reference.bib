  Abstract                 = {The effectiveness of mutation testing depends heavily on the types of faults that the mutation operators are designed to represent. Therefore, the quality of the mutation operators is key to mutation testing. Mutation testing has traditionally been applied to procedural-based languages, and mutation operators have been developed to support most of their language features. Object-oriented programming languages contain new language features, most notably inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding. Not surprisingly; these language features allow new kinds of faults, some of which are not modeled by traditional mutation operators. Although mutation operators for OO languages have previously been suggested, our work in OO faults indicate that the previous operators are insufficient to test these OO language features, particularly at the class testing level. This paper introduces a new set of class mutation operators for the OO language Java. These operators are based on specific OO faults and can be used to detect faults involving inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding, thus are useful for inter-class testing. An initial Java mutation tool has recently been completed, and a more powerful version is currently under construction.},

  Abstract                 = {Context The field of mutation analysis has been growing, both in the number of published papers and the number of active researchers. This special issue provides a sampling of recent advances and ideas. But do all the new researchers know where we started? Objective To imagine where we are going, we must first know where we are. To understand where we are, we must know where we have been. This paper reviews past mutation analysis research, considers the present, then imagines possible future directions. Method A retrospective study of past trends lets us the ability to see the current state of mutation research in a clear context, allowing us to imagine and then create future vectors. Results The value of mutation has greatly expanded since the early view of mutation as an expensive way to unit test subroutines. Our understanding of what mutation is and how it can help has become much deeper and broader. Conclusion Mutation analysis has been around for 35 years, but we are just now beginning to see its full potential. The papers in this issue and future mutation workshops will eventually allow us to realize this potential. },
